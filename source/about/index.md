title: 'What & Why?'

### What is this mess?
Rhythmic absurdity to the beat of the cosmic background radiation.

I like music, building things, programming, & electronics (and a few other things) and if you add those up and take the square root, you get this site. The synth/electronic music community is full of gracious people who share their knowledge, hard work, and passion in many ways and part of this site is my attempt to gather, organize, and share that body of knowledge. 


I am available for collaboration on strange projects. Feel free to reach out: daniel AT litfuze DOT com

Why not?
